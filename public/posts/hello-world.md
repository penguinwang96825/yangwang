# Hello World!

Welcome to my first blog post. This post demonstrates the markdown and LaTeX support for my personal website.

## Markdown Features

Here are some markdown features that are supported:

### Lists

- Item 1
- Item 2
- Item 3

### Code Blocks

```javascript
function helloWorld() {
  console.log("Hello, World!");
}
```

### Tables

| Column 1 | Column 2 | Column 3 |
|----------|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Data     | Data     |
| Row 2    | Data     | Data     |

## LaTeX Support

Here's an example of an inline equation: $E=mc^2$

And here's a block equation:

$$
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = h^2 \left( \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial x^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial y^2} + \frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial z^2} \right)
$$

## Complex Math Example

The Navier-Stokes equations describe the motion of fluids:

$$
\rho \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{v}}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v} \cdot \nabla \mathbf{v} \right) = -\nabla p + \nabla \cdot \mathbf{T} + \mathbf{f}
$$

Where:
- $\rho$ is the fluid density
- $\mathbf{v}$ is the flow velocity
- $p$ is the pressure
- $\mathbf{T}$ is the stress tensor
- $\mathbf{f}$ represents body forces

This is just a demonstration of the LaTeX capabilities of this blog system.
