# Hero Section
welcomeMessage: >
  Welcome to Yang's space! My research centers around natural language processing, 
  audio and speech language processing, and orthogonal complement projection theory. 
  Beyond academia, I've played in the UK Super League, the top league in the UK.

# About Section
about: >
  Currently researching at the University of Sheffield, where I dive into ML and NLP problems.
  I'm all about cracking tough ideas with straightforward solutions - why make things complicated?
  When I'm not coding, you might catch me explaining complex AI concepts to my friends over coffee,
  usually with too many hand gestures and sketchy napkin diagrams.
