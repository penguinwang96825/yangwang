# Hero Section
welcomeMessage: >
  Welcome to Yang's space! My research centers around natural language processing, 
  audio and speech language processing, and orthogonal complement projection theory. 
  Beyond academia, I've played in the UK Super League, the top league in the UK.

# About Section
about: >
  I am currently a researcher in machine learning and natural language processing at the University of Sheffield. 
  My work is driven by a passion for leveraging mathematical insights to develop innovative methods. 
  Recently, I have focused on designing a robust loss function through polynomial approximation for 
  margin-based loss in speaker verification, developing an instance-level principal component removal module for 
  adversarial defence, and creating a differentiable Fourier layer that adaptively processes embeddings in the 
  frequency domain to neutralise perturbations. These projects exemplify my commitment to integrating rigorous 
  mathematical perspectives with practical applications in machine learning.
